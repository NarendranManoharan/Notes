Bearer token Authorization: -authorization header
============
- Also known as "token Authentication"
-How should we understand this? Bearer Authentication == Give access to the bearer of this token
-what is a bearer token? Bearer token is cryptic string. (cryptic: not easily understandable)
-When and by whom it will be generated? generated by the server in response to a login request
-Where should we use it? When making a request to the protected resource, the request should have the bearer token in the Authorization headers

-Originally it was developed as part of OAuth 2.0, but its used individually as well

API for testing: https://api.github.com/user/repos 
APIs for GitHub can be found at:  https://docs.github.com/en/rest 
NOTE: The URL may vary in future. Rely on Google search

-Get the access tokens from GIthub page
Send the request by selecting the auth type as Bearer Token and by default the token will be added to the header as Authorization header	


Digest-Auth: (similar to two-factor authentication)
===========
-this method challenge with these parameters (Realm,nonce,qop,algorithm)
- The client send the request to the API endpoint
-If the requested resource is of protected nature,then the server going to return an 401 unauthorized response along with some values, 
Those values are,
-Realm: A string specified by the server in the WWW-authenticate response header
-Nonce: A unique string specified by the server in the www.authenticate response header
-qop: The quality of protection applied to the message. The values must be the one of the alternatives specifies by the server in WWW-authenticate response header
-need to request again with those parameters with same username and password
