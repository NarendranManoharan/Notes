Running a collection
-using monitors
-create a monitor for specific collections and set the timer to run


Workflow :

-on ither way we can set the execution order through scripts

postman.setnextRequest("value")
in value field we can set the req id also

id format: 28137962-609bc1ca-4179-43fc-a55a-51a7c2e3ada2 (userid + reqid)
first 8 numbers indicates userid: 28137962-
after that req id: 609bc1ca-4179-43fc-a55a-51a7c2e3ada2

-setnextRequest executes only after all the test snippets executes
