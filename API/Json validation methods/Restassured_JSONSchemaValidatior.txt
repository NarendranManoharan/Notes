JSON Schema
JSON - data representation
Schema- how the actual data looks

Keywords- schema, properties, representation


-Json schema is a blueprint of JSON data, schema represents how the json data build

Why we need JSON schema validation?
-We all know JSON schema is a blueprint of JSON(Request/response)
-We have seen different methods of constructing JSON payload request(String, json file, java collections, POJO)
-JSON schema validation acts as a way to ensure that the request or response JSON is as expected and in allignment with the schema we designed

How to do JSON schema validation?
-we have several libraries
- the one we using is io.rest-assured.json-schema-validator

Using rest-assured JSON schema validation we have two methods:
=============================
1)matchesJSONSchemaInClasspath()
-this methods accept only String type
-we have to keep the schema data file under src/test/resources, so that it can be pass as String inside the methods
-keep the input.json file in anywhere and load the data using File.

===============================
2)matchesJSONSchema()
-this method accept multiple input types File, InputSTream, Reader, String
