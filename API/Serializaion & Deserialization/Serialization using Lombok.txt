Serialization using Lombok:
-paste the lombok dependencies in pom.xml file
-Install the lombok in eclipse
-use @Getter , @Setter annotation in class level

problem statement?
if the code having more than 500 variables it is possible to generate getters and setters for that? It makes code clumsy

Solution:
-Lombok used to eliminate all the Boiler plate codes(getters and setters) and generate automatically using @Getter and @Setter methos
