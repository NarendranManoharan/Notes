HTTP methods(request):

GET:
-to retrieve resource representation/information only- and not to modify it in any way
-do not change the state of the resource, these are said to be safe methods
-GET APIs should be idempotent(doesnt change the state of the resource)
-GET Request will return the resource if found on the server with status codes and the response body.
-If the resource is not found, then the relevant status code will be returned.

POST:
-create a new resource

2XX--> 200 series -->indicates the success reason (200- get request success / 201-postrequest success)
3XX--> 300 series -->indicating redirection
4XX--> 400 series -->Error on client side (User can handle this)
5XX--> 500 series -->Error on server side(User cant handle this, only the server maintenance people can handle)
