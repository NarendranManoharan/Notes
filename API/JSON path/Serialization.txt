Serialization:
-is the process of converting a data object into a byte stream, and saving the state of the object to be stored on a disk or transmitted across the network

Deserialization:
-covert back to original state of data


object -> serialization -> Network -> Deserialize -> object


Serialization problems:
-Java code get the key and value parameters from user as java object type
-But while transfer in network it should be as json type
-so convert java object into json using libraries like jackson(Databin, Gson etc.., 

To Overcome:
Use libraris of Jackson
-it will automatically convert the data into JSON
