Array slicing operations:
1) [start:end] start index incuded and end index excluded 
2)start value and end value is optional
3)if start value is not given it will set default as 0.
4)if the end value is not provided, the last element will be default(based on array length)
5)Negative numbers iterate from the end of the array
6)If the starting and ending number is same it will return the empty list
7)It supports left to right reading
8)If start element is greater than arraylength , empty array is returned
9)if end element id greater than array length, slicing happens until the end of the array
