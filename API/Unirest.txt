Using unirest:
1. Copy the maven dependency for unirest
2. unirest.post("url).body("json body).asJSON();

Stateless - when user login the server cant create the state, it create access token instaed
-by using the access token the api can hit any server in the specific application

Stateful - user state created in the server when the user loged in , it leads to load balancer cant send the API to another server 
i.e: a XXX application has two server 
-on first time user login in server 1,it creates the user state(session id) in that server
-in case the server cant handle the extreme load, the load balancer send the user api to the server 2, but in server 2 the user state is not cretaed.
-so it cause some difficulties
