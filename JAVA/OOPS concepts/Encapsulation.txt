
Encapsulation
- process of binding data and methods together into a single unit {class}
-encapsulation means enclosing thedata in a container. It is done to hide the details and it is acheived by the help of 
 access modifiers like public, protected and private

ex: Page Object model
- In POM the webelement can find and declared in private so that it can hide within the class
- to use the webelement from other class we can create method with public access and logging the webelement
- So that we can acheive encapsulation


Access modifiers:
1.default - access only within the package, when no access modifiers is specified , java consider itself as a default modifiers
2.private - only within the class in which they are declared
3.protected - within the same package/sub classes(child class) in different package
4.public - from everywhere in the program.
