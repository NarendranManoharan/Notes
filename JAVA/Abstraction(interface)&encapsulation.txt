Abstraction - hiding the implementation details

how to acheive abstraction 
1. Abstract class (0 - 100% abstraction)
2.Interface (100% abstraction)

- if any one of the method(function) in class is abstract then the calss name also be abstract
- if a class is having  one unimplemented method, then the method should be declared abstract	
- abstract class have both abstract method and concrete method
- Abstract class wont allow to create object
- if the child does not implement all the abstract methods of parent class, then the child class need to be declared abstract as well



Interface
-Like a class but it is not a class
- interface can have methods and variables just like class but the variables are public, static and final by default
- methods declared in interface are abstract by default
- class can use the interface using the implements keyword
- an interface use another interface by using extends keyword


Encapsulation
- process of binding data and methods together into a single unit {class}
