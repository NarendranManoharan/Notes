-----
Process of acquirng the properties(data+methods{functions})

Types:
single : a->b
multi-level: A->B->C
Multiple :(Not supported in java) A+B->c (to overcome we use interface)

Access modifiers:
1.default - when no access modifiers is specified , java consider itself as a default modifiers
2.private - only within the class in which they are declared
3.protected - within the same package/sub classes(child class) in different package
4.public - from everywhere in the program.
