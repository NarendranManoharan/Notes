-----------------
Static Keyword
-use with  class, variable, method and block{}
- if we make a member as static we can acces the member in the class without the help of object. we can directly call the member.
 (Static memeber doesnt need anyone help like object, they can call as individual)	
- we can call static method from non static method but vice versa not allowed

Static block
-class can have multiple static blocks
- gets execute when the class is loaded in memory
- static block have high priority than main method in execution

Static variables
- common to all the instances (or object) of the class because it is a class level variable
- while using static keyword to the variable it stores the final given values to all the object.

Static class
- A class can be static only if the class is nested class
 dont need this bcoz we wont use nested class
