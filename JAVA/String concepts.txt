
String interface implements serializable, comparable and charsequence
Charsequence implements String , stringbuffer and stringBuilder (child classes)

Immutable (if the duplicate value is created it is not override the old one, its just point the new one, then the old one is still in the heap memory)
Mutable (if the duplicate value is created it will override the excisting one)
--------------------------

String concepts
- its a character sequence
- its immutable(non changable)

methods:
charat
indexat
length
etc..,


types
-String literal (memory efficiency)--heap memory
-new String keyword

------------------------
String Buffer 
-is mutable (changable)
- is synchronized/thread safe (multiple thread cant access simultaneously)
- only work with new keyword not with literal (StringBuffer s=new StringBuffer("naren"))  {not work with --> StringBuffer s="naren"}

methods:
1.reverse
2.replace
3.delete
4.insert
5.capacity

String builder
- is mutable (changable)
- is non synchronized/not thread safe (multiple threads can access it simultaneously)

methods:
1.reverse
2.replace
3.delete
4.insert
5.capacity
