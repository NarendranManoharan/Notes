Collection:

List.........
1.Arraylist (C)
2.Linked list (C)
3.Vector (C) ----- not imp -legacy classes
4.Stack (C)----- not imp  - legacy classes





1.Arraylist (C) - supports easy search and difficult in insertion and deletion (Array box concept)
Instance 

Parentclass                   Childclass
List<String> arrayList= new Arraylist<String>();
<> --> Generics

-maintain the insertion order
-Multiple Null insertion is possible in arraylist
-In array list duplicate string allowed (add method)
-arrayList is not preferable for insertion and deletion
-it is preferable for retrieval operation
-default capacity of arraylist is 10

Data structure : resizeable Array  or growable array
-to retrieve (get method)
-to know thw index position (indexof)
-if the search element not present in arraylist it will return -1
-it is not synchronized and not thread safe
-datastructure is resizeable Array  or growable array
-if generics is not added in list instance we can add any kind of datatype in the list

Iterating methods in List
1.for each
2.for
3.Iterator (only for forward traversing)
4.ListIterator<String> iterator= arrayList.listIterator();
  -forward traversing (hasnext())
  -reverse traversing (hasprevious())
  List only have the above iterator
  


2.Linked list (Refer https://visualgo.net/)

Data structure: Doubly linked list
- it is not effective for search operation (time complexity, traverse through every element to search), preferable for insert and delete
- there is no default capacity for linked list
-linkedlist implents only two marker interface(Serializable, clonable), not implements Random access

Synatx
