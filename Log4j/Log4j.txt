Logger:

1)Logging- process of writing log messages.

2)why do we need logging?
If we use syso print statements to print log messages we can print log messages on console only
So, when the console is closed, we will lose all those logs.

3)Log4j components
   a)Logger -> a class inside the org.apache.log4j pacakage
              We have to initialize one logger object for eacj Java class
			  We have logger class methods to indicate log levels
			  Logger class methods: debug,info,warn,error,fatal
			  
	b)Appender -> to write messages into a file or DB or SMTP
	      Few types are:
		  a) JDBCAppender
		  b) FileAppender
		  c) ConsoleAppender
		  
	c)Layout -> to define the formatting in which logs will print in a repository'
	       a) PatternLayout
		   b) SimpleLayout
		   c) XMLLayout
		   d) HTMLLayout
		   
4)Log4j priority levels
 debug < info < warn < error < fatal
 
 
5) Different ways to configure log4j
