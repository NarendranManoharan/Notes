Maven- build automation tool(internet based)   ---refer maven official website
WHY Maven-


Terminologies--
groupid - company name(com.google)
artifact id- project name(gmail)
archetype - template of the project
dependencies - dependent JAr files for the project
plugins - surefile,compiler,copy plugins


1) to maintain proper folder structure

--maven maintains proper folder structure for main and test codes
--resource folder contains other than the source codes
--main folder contains actual code and test folder contains test code
--test code is not an actual code only main source code can make as build to end user


2)to manage dependencies on our behalf

--pom.xml (Project object model)
--pom.xml contains the all dependencies and plugins

--maven can download the respective jar files internally while using the dependencies
-- transient dependencies (one jar file which is dependent to other jar file)
--maven serach the dependencies in the local repository(c:/users/narman/.m2/repository/respective jar name) whether is present or not, if it is not present then download the respective dependencies from central repository
--just copy the pom.xml file to other device to manage all dependencies. not necessary to download everything
--update the jdk version by using compiler plugins and update the maven project manually


3) how maven build the code for us

-- build proccess is to change the source code to installable or executable file 

windows- exe  
android- apk
java- jar

-- build the project in normal java project 

project/export/export as runable jar/next
Launch config dropdown shows all the main classes , in that we need to select which main type need to take
library handling is to handle the supporting files to execute in the installing machine

-after build success get a JAR file which is executable
Execute command: java -jar filename.jar


--build the project in maven 
project/runas/mavenbuild/goals-package/apply
generated the jar file in the respective folder, need to execute that
Execute command: java -jar filename.jar

error handling: No main manifest attribute
Need to mention the main method in manifest.mf  (target/classes/meta.inf/manifest.mf)

to resolve the error need to add the plugins
-maven jar plugin
-dependencu copy plugin

now the jar file is executable



4) can create documentation site

site (for documentation)

5)Build lifecycle of maven

-Default (Validate,compile,test,verify,install,deploy)
-clean
-site (create a new site folder under target)

Phases: lifecycle comprises of several phases

validate- validate whether the artifact id missing (for ex)
compile- compile the source code (converion of .java to .cls)
test- test does not need to package or deploy
package- take the compiled code and package in its distributable format such as JAR
Verify - run any checks on result of integration
Install - install the package(JAR file) into the local repository(.m2)
deploy - copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects
