1)Black box testing?
    -test the product without knowing the actual implementation and the source code of the product
	
	How to do black box testing
	 - User story
	 - Input
	 - Test Strategy
	 - Test case design techniques
	 - Test case
	 - Execute
	 - Closure
	 
	 Types:
	  - All Functional requirement
	  - Non-functional 
	  - Rgression 
	  
2)White box testing?
      - internal structure,
	  -design and coding of software are tested to verify the flow of input-output and to improve design, usability and security
	  
	  
3)Functional vs non-functional
    - to test the functionallity of the product
	- to test the performance of the product is called as non-functional
	
4)Smoke testing? (stability)
    -to find whether the build is stable or not by testing whether the most critical components working or not
	-to save effort and time
	
  A sample flow
     Dev team release build - > QA team performs test on critical components
	 ->build is stable ->further testing ->build fails ->send back to developer

5)Sanity testing?(rational)
   -performed after a new build is received
   -this new build could be a reusltant of inclusion of new functionality or due to bug fix
   
6)Regression testing
    -testing the existing(across the system) and no new issues raised(across the system) 
	  
7)Retesting -> to check if the bug has been fixed or not


8)Adhoc testing
  
  What is ad-hoc testing?
  -done without being planned, organized or reheaesed
  -testing an application using logical an illogical scenarios and check whether the application has any bugs
  or not is called ad-hoc testing
  
  Types: Buddy(dev+tev), Pair, Monkey(Gorilla)
 
9)Defect and Bug
   - both are interchangable
   -deviation b/w  actual and expected behaviour of the application
   
10) Bug Lifecycle

 findBug -> new/Open -> Assigned to DEV ->validate the bug whether itis valid or not 
 ->In progress ->fix ->testing
 
11)severity vs Priority

Severity: It is a measure to indicate the impact of the bug can have on the software product

Categories of severity:
-Low
-Minor
-Major
-Critical

Priority: Bug priority refers to how urgently a bug needs to be fixed

levels of bug priority:
-Low
-Medium
-High


12)STLC

Requirement Analysis:
-Testing team studies the functional/non-functional requirements from testing point of view
-Automation feasibility for the testing project is also done in this stage
-Find out what types of tests to be done
-Create requirement traceability matrix.


Test Planning:
-A test plan is a detailed document that details the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimations
deadlines and the resources required for completing the particular project

-It is a blueprint of runing the tests needed to ensure the software is working properly maintained by 
Test architects or test managers


Testcase Developement:
-Once the test plan is ready, the test data is colected for the testing and then test cases are written and reviewed

Test environment setup:
-Mostly this will be done by operations Team or sometimes Dev team.
-when the environment is setup, smoke test is performed

Test Execution:
-This is the regular part of the work for testers
-executing the test cases, finding the bugs, tracking the bugs to closure, retesting, mapping defects to test cases in RTM are some activities comes under this phase

Test closure;
-Test completion, collection of test results and report metrics.
-Analyse the artifacts obtained in this cycle and plan for effective future testing
