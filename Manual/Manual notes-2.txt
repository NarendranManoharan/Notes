Entry Criteria:
A set of conditions to be met/satisfied before an activity can begin
Exit criteria:
A set of conditions to be met/satisfied before an activity can be concluded
======================================


Test scenarios:
-It is a breakup of a business requirement in a form of possible use cases 
-With the help of test scenarios we can provide more test coverage for the functionalities in the application

Requirement Traceability matrix:
-is a document that maps and traces user requirement with test cases
-mainpurpose of the document is to validate all the requirements are tested by atleast one test case 
-SO that is no functionallity is unchecked during software testing


Testing principles:
-Testing shows presence of defects
-Absence of errors fallacy
-Early Testing
-Exhaustive testing is not possible
-Defect Clustering (80% of the defect causing by the 20% of the module. so focus on that 20%)
-pesticide paradox (same set of test cases will never find new bugs)
-Testing is context dependent

Test case design Techniques:
1)Specification Based Techniques
    -Equivalence Partitioning
	-Boundary vaue Analysis
	-Decision Table
	-State Transition Techniques
	-Orthogonal Arrays
	-Use Case Testing
	
2)Structure based techniques
    -Statement coverage
	-Decision coverage
	-Path coverage
	-Condition coverage

3)Experience based techniques
    - Exploratory testing
	-Error Guessing



================
1)Equivalence Partitioning (In-between data range)
  The whole range of input data for a given requirement are grouped into several sets or equivalent classes
  
2)Boundary value Analysis (Boundary data range)
  -to test the boundaries which separates the continuos range of inputs
     -LOWER Boundary cases
	 -Upper Boundary cases
	 -On Boundary cases
	 
3)Decision table (Cause and Effect table)
   -help us to test the systems behaviour with various set of inputs
   -this technique can also be called Cause and Effect table, as it captures the driving factor (cause, input data)
    and captures the effect (output) in the tabular format.
	
4)State Transition Technique:
  - the state of an application for any given input and how the state is getting transitioned from one to another
-State (initial state)
-transition (changing state from one to another)
-Event (Action performed on that)
-Action (given output by software)


5)Use Case testing (end user POV testing)
 -process of defining the actions done by the actors/users on the responses of the system for the corresponding action.
 -it is a software testing tehnique helps to identify test cases which covers the entire system on a transaction by transaction basis from start to end.
 

6)Error Guessing Technique:
   -Error Guessing is the method of black box testing that relies solely on the previous experience of the tester
   -that software tester uses their past experience to determine where errors in the software may be.
