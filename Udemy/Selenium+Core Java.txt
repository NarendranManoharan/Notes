1)Why Selenium Automation tool
-Open source platform free to use. This method does not need to allot budget
-Works with multiple system windows, linux, mac
-It allows cross-browser testing , Supports all programming language
-Selenium Grid concept allows parallel execution

2)Soft assertion - Soft assertion not throw an exception when assert fails, it continue with the next step
Hard assertion - Hard assertion throws an Assert exception immediately when an assert condition fails and test suite continue with next @Test

3)Static methods and variables
-The methods or variables defined as static are shared among all the objects of the class
-The static keyword is the part of the class not for objects
- ststic varible are store in class area, and we do not need to create object to access such variables

4)this and super
this
- this is the keyword refers to the current class local variable
- this keyword is used to initialize class level variables in the constructor using local variables
- this keyword only used within the constructor (so that it can initilaize the constructor values once the object is created)

super (when there is confict in the name between super and child class)
- super refer to the immediate parent class reference variable
- super keyword can also be used to invoke parent class method and parent class constructor

5)Difference between Array and ArrayList
Array is a fixed length data structure 
Arraylist is a variable length collection class
-in array the length is defined while created whereas arraylist we can add the length to n number on runtime

6)Hashmap and  HashTable
Hashmap is non synchronized. It is not thread-safe 
HashTable is synchronized. It is thread-safe can be share with many threads
Hashmap allows one null key and multiple null values
HashTable doesnt allow any null key or value

7)Final, finally and finalize
Final - keyword 
- Final keyword is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variables
- Final clas cannot be inherited
-Final method cannot be overridden
-Final variable cannot be changed

Finally - block
-is used to place important code,it will be executed whether the exception is handled or not

Finalize - method
-is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected
finalize(); system.gc();


8)When should i use selenium Grid?
- whenever execute the test on different platforms(parallel testing)
