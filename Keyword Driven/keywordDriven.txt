Keyword driven framework:
all the actions in class have function a method type that user can easily understandable

-write all the functions in keywords class
-in runner class(main cls) we need to set the equal ignore condition with excel value and function name

drawback: code maintain is not easy 
overcome: Use Reflection API
          classname.getClass().getMethods();
		  
- get the method name using reflection API and compare it with the excel value
