 Jenkins
 -Continuous Integration (CI)/delivery (CD)/deployment
 -open source framework
 
 
 Continuous Integration:
 -practice of runnning your tests on a non-devloper machine automatically everytime someone pushes new code into the source repository
 -In other words whenever we add some new code and commit it to the repository,we have to ensure that the new one shouldn't break the 
   existing working code
 -So its mandatory to run automated tests for every new commit.
 - This kind of continuous integration testing process is called CI.
 
 Continuous delivery:
 -it is like a preparation process
 -the process of making the code to be deployable
 
 Continuous deployment:
 -it is the actual process of deployment
 
 Tool we are using Jenkins( bamboo, Travis CI, hudson)
