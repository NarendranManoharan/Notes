Inspector (Code generator) & debugging:
================================
Pre requisite: mvn installed in system

Step 1: Navigate to the respective path in CLI

Step 2: copy the codegen command from playwright page:
 ======>> mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc"
 - have to pass the url inside the command

Step 3: once the url open code cn automatically generated for each and every action performed

Step 4: Stop the recording and get the code from codegen



Debugging: (record & play)
===============
Step 1: Pass the env variable PWDEBUG=1, then the code debug line by line
To add environment variable
 Runas>Run config>envirnment>PWDEBUG=1
 
Another way
-while debugging we can add futher steps bu using record option

page.pause(); -->used as breakpoint. from here the debugging starts
