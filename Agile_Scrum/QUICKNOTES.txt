How the scrum works
-Getting the requirement from the client
_Product owner make the requirmemnt as mappping and prioritize the requirements based on client need
-in that map all the requirememt is in type of epic and what are all the user stories placed under the epic 
-And making the map as Backlog

Story points
- overall effort required to fully implemented a PBI
- Traditional software teams give  estimates in a time format: days, weeks, months
- that is easier to provide estimates , but thats not what we will do in agile
- already mentioned that story point is effort and effort is not equal to time
