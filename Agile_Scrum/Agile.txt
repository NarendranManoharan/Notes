Types of SDLC methods:
1.Waterfall
2.Spiral
3.V model
4.Agile
etc.,

Waterfall:
 -Requirement
  -Analysis
   -Design
    -Implementation
     -Testing
      -Deployment
       -Maintenance

Waterfall- can either be a huge success or huge failure
Drawbacks:
-requirements must be clear and stable
-Testing comes lates
-documentation timing
-Chances of correcting the error very minimal, chances of error are high
===========================
Agile - adapt the changes

agile misconsumptions
-agile is fast
-user can give requirement at any point if time in developement
-No documentation needed


Frameworks
-Scrum
-KANBAN
-SAFe


SCRUM (iterative and incremental)

-Scrum is framework used in agile methodology to develop the project
-Scrum is a iterative and incremental process
-framework for developing and sustaining complex products

Scrum roles:
-Developers(Team)
-Product owner (on behalf of customer)
-Scrum master


_backlog - Pending task(product backlog/sprint backlog)
_Sprint planning- Discussion b/w product owner and team about take set of requirement and complete with in set of mandays
_Standup/Scrum meeting - what we have done yesterday and what to do today and any showstopers
_Sprint review - product review
_Sprint Retrospective - review on team members how they perform in task



Product owner: 
- providing the vision of the project to the team
- Managing the product backlog the in a clear and transparent way
- Prioritize the backlog to achieve the best
- providing the product backlog in a clear way to team so that they can make better decisions

Team:
- Self organized(what to commit and how to commit)
- cross functional(anlaysis, dev, testing, DB)-->knowledge about everything
- Team is accountable as a whole (No blame game on a single person)
- Usually 7 to 10 persons

Scrum master: (Agile, Scrum coach)
- Helps team to adopt scrum and self organise
- Protects the team from outside interference
- Conducts scrums events
- Eliminates obstruction for the progress of the team

Note: Scrum master is NOT and Should NOT be the Product owner/Manager

Note: Every sprint must have a potentially shippable increment 
  
Scrum artifacts:
- work or value created by the scrum participants which is transparent and helps team to inspect and adapt 
- the artifact details the product  being developed , actions needed to produce the product and actions performed during the project



Product backlog - its not a stagnant one it also evolve with the developement (requirement can add at any point of time)
Sprint Backlog - set of tasks selected from the product backlog. to develop the sprint backlog with the prioritise tasks which extracted from product backlog
Increment - resultant product of the sprint produced by complete the sprint backlog  tasks


Scrum values:
-courage
-focus
-committment
-Respect
-Openness
