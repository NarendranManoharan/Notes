Selenium
-open-source test automation suite used for automating web-based applications
-supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages.

Components of Selenium Suite:
-Selenium IDE -record and playback automation tool
-Selenium RC - deprectaed
-Selenium Webdriver -
-Selenium Grid -helps in the distributed running of Selenium tests in parallel across multiple remote machines.

Limitations of Selenium:
-Does not support desktop application
-webservices (REST/SOAP)cannot be automated
-logging, reading/writing files rely on external libraries


Architecture of Selenium 4:

Selenium Client libraries -> W3C protocol -> Browser Drivers ->Browser
